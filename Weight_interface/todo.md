* Split weights into dimension-based categories: Generalized_weights_1/2/3/d.
* All analytic weights should follow the same concept.
* I should first submit the Barycentric_coordinates_2 package taking into account that
  it will be later modified by using the Weight_interface package.
* Then I should submit the Weight_interface package that will also modify the internals
  of the Barycentric_coordinates_2 package.
* Finally, I will submit a set of features that will modify internals of such packages
  as Interpolation, Polygon_mesh_processing, Surface_mesh_parameterization, Surface_mesh_skeletonization,
  Surface_mesh_deformation, Surface_mesh_shortest_path, Heat_method_3, and possibly Kernel_d.
* When computing weights one by one, we recompute certain areas/distances multiple times and so
  using them e.g. in barycentric coordinates is not efficient. What should we do with that?
