\ingroup PkgWeightInterfaceRef

Models and functions that can be used to compute barycentric weights with respect
to polygons. These weights are then normalized in order to obtain barycentric coordinates.

Models and functions that can be used to compute weighting regions. These weights are
used to balance other weights.
