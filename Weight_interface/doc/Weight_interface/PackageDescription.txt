\cgalPkgDesc{Many geometric algorithms rely on weighted constructions. This package
provides a simple and unified interface to different types of weights. In particular,
it includes numerous weights with a simple analytic expression, generalized barycentric
weights, and weighting regions. All weights are available both in 2D and 3D.}
