* Comment the code.
* Spell check all files.
* Remove all unnecessary functions or put them in experimental.
* I think I should remove all traits parameters. See Shape Detection.
* Cleanup Solver_interface one more time. Ask Simon to have a look.
* Change QPTraits name to QPSolver.

* Install OSQP on all testing platforms.
* Add a 3D version of the QP regularization algorithm.
* Add an opencv tutorial with the global segments regularization over the Chicago map.
* Should we carry out a rigorous performance analysis?
* Do we actually care about the clockwise/counterclockwise order in the contours?
