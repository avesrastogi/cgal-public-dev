* Check memory leaking.

* Install OSQP on all testing platforms.
* Add a 3D version of the QP regularization algorithm.
* Add an opencv tutorial with the global segments regularization over the Chicago map.
* Should we carry out a rigorous performance analysis?
* Do we actually care about the clockwise/counterclockwise order in the contours? Add a test.
* Add a test with random segments.
