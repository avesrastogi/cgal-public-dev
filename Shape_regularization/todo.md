* Comment the code.
* Spell check all files.
* Cleanup Solver_interface one more time.
* Remove all unnecessary functions or put them in experimental.
* Add more objects from the traits class e.g. the sqrt object and/or centroid/midpoint.

* Install OSQP on all testing platforms.
* Add a 3D version of the QP regularization algorithm.
* Add an opencv tutorial with the global segments regularization over the Chicago map.
* Should we carry out a rigorous performance analysis?
* Do we actually care about the clockwise/counterclockwise order in the contours?
