    \brief regularizes closed contours.

    Given a set of counterclockwise ordered 2D points connected by segments, which form a closed contour,
    this function enables to reinforce three types of regularities among consecutive edges of this contour:
    - *Parallelism*: contour edges, which are detected as near parallel, are made exactly parallel.
    - *Orthogonality*: contour edges, which are detected as near orthogonal, are made exactly orthogonal.
    - *Collinearity*: parallel contour edges, which are detected as near collinear, are made exactly collinear.

    The principal directions of the contour are provided via the concept `ContourDirections`.
