required for setting up the the global regularization problem.

    updates regularization characteristics (angle-orientation/distance-offset/etc.)
    of the geometric objects being regularized using values from `solution`, one
    value per one regularized object. These values depend on what is being regularized,
    they could be angle or offset differences for example. The solution vector is
    computed by the `QuadraticProgramTraits`.

    Number of values in `solution` equals to the number n of geometric objects being
    regularized + the number m of neighbor pairs between these objects. The first
    n values are the values that should be used.

    `CGAL::Shape_regularization::QP_regularization` calls this method
    once after the global regularization QP problem has been solved.
