\cgalConcept

We assume that each contour has one or several principal directions. By implementing
a model of this concept, the user sets such directions and provides a way to orient
contour edges towards these directions. All contour regularization functions
in this package are parameterized by this concept.

- `CGAL::Shape_regularization::Contours::Multiple_directions_2`,
